Hi, my name is Viktoria. 

Here is my project with test task for Junior JavaScript vacancy in Pecode company.

My own test case:

"Verify the user can login successfully"
1. Open marketplace url. Verify it.
2. Open the window for login.
3. Enter the user email and password (test@gmail.com, 12345678).
4. Verify that user login successfully.

(This test failed, because the user with current creds does not exist. So, user can not be logined successfully)
